# **COA TASKFORCE TAKE HOME CHALLENGE** 

## Overview
> This project includes an interactive photo gallery and two JavaScript coding challenges. The photo gallery is responsive and matches the provided Figma designs. The coding challenges examples use real-world words related to food to illustrate the transformations applied based on the divisibility of the string length by 3, 5, and 15.demonstrate logical thinking and coding aptitude.

### Requirements:

1. Responsive Design: The interactive photo gallery should adapt seamlessly
to different screen sizes and devices
2. Figma Design Accuracy: Match the provided Figma designs pixel-perfectly,
including layout, spacing, typography, and visual styles
3. Hover Interaction: Implement the hover interaction as shown in the Figma
prototype, displaying additional details when a user hovers over a photo
4. Cross-browser Compatibility: Ensure consistent performance across
modern web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
there.

### Objective:
- The purpose of this coding challenge is to assess your skills in HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, as well as your problem-solving abilities.You will be tasked with
building an interactive photo gallery based on provided Figma designs.


###  ðŸ“– Task Details:
**Access the Figma designs:**
- Follow this figma link to view the designs in prototype mode: Figma Link
- The designs showcase the interactive photo gallery for both desktop and
mobile views
- Use these designs as a visual reference for implementing the gallery
**Set up your development environment:**
- Choose your preferred code editor or IDE
- Ensure you have the necessary tools and frameworks installed (e.g., HTML,
CSS, JavaScript)
**Create a public GitHub repository:**
- Sign in to your GitHub account or create a new one if you don't have an
account
- Create a new public repository for this challenge
- Clone the repository to your local machine
**Organize your project:**
- Create appropriate directories and files for your code and assets
- Use meaningful names for files and folders to maintain clarity and
organization

**Implement the interactive photo gallery:**
- Start with the HTML structure, creating the necessary elements for the
gallery
- Style the gallery using CSS, following the design guidelines from Figma
- Implement interactivity and functionality using JavaScript
- Test your implementation regularly to ensure it works as expected

# Coding Challenge

## 1. String Transformation and Contiguous Subarray Challenges

- Contiguous Subarray Problem: Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

## 2. String Transformation Problem: Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:

- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.
